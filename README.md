# Snippet Bar

> Menubar-based Snippet Manager

### What Do?

Our goal is to provide a home for your snippets - code or otherwise. Snippet Bar aims to give quick access to your most used snippets:
- easily copy a selected snippet to your clipboard
- create / update / tag snippets
- search snippets by title, text and tags
- view code with toggle-able syntax highlighting

Snippet Bar works on Linux, Mac and Windows, but is still in it's testing phases. So far, we have packaged a Mac app, which you can download.
