# Snippet Bar

> A desktop menubar app for copying, pasting and re-using text snippets

Our goal is to provide a home for your snippets - code or otherwise. Snippet Bar aims to give quick access to your most used snippets:
- create and manage your snippets by giving them titles and tags
- search and select a snippet to copy to your clipboard
- enable optional syntax highlighting for viewing code snippets

### Which platforms are supported?

Snippet Bar works on Linux, Mac and Windows. But it's still in the testing phase. So far, we have only packaged a Mac app that's available for download.

### Are more features on the horizon?

This is our first release. We have future ideas on how to improve and expand Menu Bar, however it might be a while before we get started.

We welcome any pull requests, suggestions and logged issues!

### What technologies did you use?

Snippet Bar is built with React, Flux, Electron and some other awesome packages including:
- [Hightlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/)
